Groovy shares many keywords with Java, as it runs on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) and is designed to be interoperable with Java. Additionally, Groovy introduces its own set of keywords and features to enhance expressiveness and provide dynamic language capabilities. Here are some Groovy keywords:

Java Keywords:

import: Used to import Java or Groovy classes.
package: Defines the package of the current Groovy script or class.
class: Declares a class.
interface: Declares an interface.
extends: Indicates the superclass of a class.
implements: Implements an interface.
static: Indicates a static method or property.
new: Creates a new instance of a class.
return: Returns a value from a method.
void: Specifies that a method returns no value.
super: Refers to the superclass.
this: Refers to the current instance.
if, else if, else: Conditional statements.
for, while, do-while: Looping constructs.
Groovy-Specific Keywords:

def: Declares a variable without specifying its type. Groovy is dynamically typed, so def is often used.
as: Performs type casting.
in: Used for iteration, especially in enhanced for loops.
each: Applies a closure to each element in a collection.
collect: Transforms elements of a collection using a closure.
findAll, find: Filter elements of a collection based on a condition.
switch, case, default: Provides a switch statement.
it: Implicit variable in closures, representing the current item.
?.: Safe navigation operator, avoids null pointer exceptions.
?:: Elvis operator, provides a default value if the left side is null.
?.[]: Safe indexing operator for arrays and lists.
Closures:

Groovy places a strong emphasis on closures, and several keywords and operators are associated with them:
->: Separates closure parameters and body.
{}: Encloses the body of a closure.
->>: Collects the results of closure executions.
each, collect, findAll, etc.: Methods often used with closures.
Annotations:

@AnnotationName: Annotations are used to add metadata to code, and they start with the '@' symbol.
These are some of the keywords commonly used in Groovy. The language's design philosophy encourages readability and conciseness, and many features contribute to a more expressive and flexible coding style compared to traditional statically-typed languages like Java.

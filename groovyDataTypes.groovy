Groovy is a dynamically typed language, meaning that variable types are determined at runtime. It is designed to be concise and expressive, and it has some similarities to Java. Here are the main data types in Groovy:

Primitive Data Types:

Integer:

groovy
Copy code
def num = 42
Decimal/Floating Point:

groovy
Copy code
def pi = 3.14
Boolean:

groovy
Copy code
def isTrue = true
Character:

groovy
Copy code
def letter = 'A'
String:
Groovy supports both single-quoted and double-quoted strings. Double-quoted strings support string interpolation.

groovy
Copy code
def name = 'John'
def greeting = "Hello, $name!"
Lists:

groovy
Copy code
def numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
Maps:

groovy
Copy code
def person = [name: 'John', age: 30, city: 'New York']
Ranges:

groovy
Copy code
def range = 1..5
Arrays:
While Groovy often uses lists, you can use arrays as well:

groovy
Copy code
def arr = [1, 2, 3] as int[]
Closures:
Groovy has first-class support for closures, which are similar to anonymous functions or lambdas in other languages.

groovy
Copy code
def multiply = { x, y -> x * y }
Null:
Groovy has a special null value.

groovy
Copy code
def value = null
Classes and Objects:
Groovy supports object-oriented programming with classes and objects.

groovy
Copy code
class Person {
    String name
    int age
}

def person = new Person(name: 'Alice', age: 25)
BigInteger and BigDecimal:
Groovy supports arbitrary precision integers and decimals.

groovy
Copy code
def bigInteger = 1234567890123456789012345678901234567890
def bigDecimal = 3.1415926535897932384626433832795028841971693993751058209749445923078164062862089986280348253421170679
These are some of the main data types in Groovy. Groovy's dynamic nature makes it easy to work with different types, and it provides convenient syntax for expressing data structures like lists, maps, and closures. Keep in mind that Groovy's syntax is often concise and expressive, which contributes to its readability and ease of use.
